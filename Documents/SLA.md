# Service Level Agreement

This is a formal service commitment between **Group14-Development** & **GroupF-Operation**.  
The document intends to create a contract between the two to have a common agreement on the operational of the application.   The document only gives an operational view of Hackernews and has nothing to do with the development of the application.  That is stated in another contract.  


## High Availability (Uptime)  
Hackernews will function **95%** of the time. 

## Customer Satisfaction


## Mean Time Recovery

## Time To Respond on Issues

## Quality Assurance

## Change Request

## Incident Request
There will be four priority types of incidents for the current Hackernews application. Each type has its own KPI.  
**1 - Urgent Incident - 6 hours
2 - Important Incident - 12 hours
3 - Moderate Incident - 72 hours
4 - Minor Incident - 168 hours**  

The hours are defined as a TTR (Time-to-respond). On **Urgent** & **Important** incidents there will always be taken care of it right away, but the oper



Everything is monthly based. This means that at the end of the month the KPI's will be evalutated. If they are above the thresholds set in the SLA-agreement, the customer will not get any credit. If it is below the thresholds, a calculation will be made for the customer. 

The whole contract is apealed if a global issue occurs. This could be certificates failure from **Globalsign**, a infrastructure breakdown at **Hetzner.com**, natural disasters, or similar issues. This is out of our hands and therefore Group14 can't take responsibility for these causes.
