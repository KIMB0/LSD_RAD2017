# Assignment 10 - Scaling

This is the tenth weekly assignment in the Large Systems Development curse. The assignment description can be found [here](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/mod/assign/view.php?id=52923).

## What is Docker Swarm, and why do we need it?

Docker Swarm combines the useful commands and functionality of Docker, with cluster functionality (Swarmkit). This means that it is possible to run a swarm of Docker hosts (workers) on a single, virtual host - known as the Manager. 

## How can it help eliminating bottlenecks?

Docker Swarm provides multiple useful features that (in itself or in combination) can elimante bottlenecks in a setup. These features include **load balancing** (automatic distribution of work where it's needed), **scaling** (mulitple running replica services), **automatic service restart** and many more.
