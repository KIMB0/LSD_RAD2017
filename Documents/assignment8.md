# Assignment 8 - Security
**Group E**

## Threat modeling

By modeling our threats, we are trying to identify different security factors surrounding our project. Mainly where we could be vulnerable, and who would potentially exploit that.
The key is to get an overview of threats, so we know where we should apply the most effort to keep the system secure. 

The basic terminology:
- **Assets**: This is a resource of value. This could be our data in our database.
- **Threats**: This is a threat which may compromise our assets.
- **Vulnerabilities**: This is the weakness in our system that makes the threat possible.

## Risk matrix


The Risk matrix tries to capture the possible threats/scenarios from the previous section, along with a categorization in terms of likelihood and consequence severity.
By using the risk matrix table, we're increasing the visibility of the risks. We can easily see which risks we should put our fucus on.
